# Getting Started with Create React App

To run and test the app follow these steps:

1. Install the dependencies with npm install

2. Create your own .env file at the root of the directory where you store your own API key.
   Example: REACT_APP_WEATHER_API_KEY={api-key}

3. In the project directory, you can run npm start to run the app in development mode.
